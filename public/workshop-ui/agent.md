# M3E Canvas: sketches from an AI agent (beta)

M3E Canvas (https://lnkiai.github.io/m3e-canvas/) is a browser editor for Material 3 Expressive screens. A design is one JSON document. You, the agent, write that document and hand it back; the person opens it on their canvas, refines it, and turns it into a prompt for a coding tool.

This format is in beta. Fields may be added; existing ones keep their meaning.

## What to deliver

**Reply with a share link.** If you cannot run code, reply with the JSON document itself in a code block; the person saves it as a `.json` file and opens it with **Open project**. Either way, **do not verify, decode, or round-trip your output**: the app checks the document when it opens and tells the person what is wrong, so your checks add nothing.

To make the link:

1. Save the document to a file, for example `design.json`. Do not inline it in a shell command; quoting breaks in PowerShell and long shells.
2. Run one of these on the file and reply with the printed link.

```js
// Node (link.mjs): node link.mjs design.json
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { deflateRawSync } from "node:zlib";
const json = readFileSync(process.argv[2], "utf8");
console.log("https://lnkiai.github.io/m3e-canvas/#docz=" + deflateRawSync(json).toString("base64url"));
```

```python
# Python (link.py): python link.py design.json
import sys, zlib, base64
data = open(sys.argv[1], "rb").read()
c = zlib.compressobj(9, zlib.DEFLATED, -15)          # raw deflate, no header
raw = c.compress(data) + c.flush()
print("https://lnkiai.github.io/m3e-canvas/#docz=" + base64.urlsafe_b64encode(raw).decode().rstrip("="))
```

The link is long (a few thousand characters for a few screens). That is expected; it carries the whole design and nothing is stored anywhere. If you fetched this guide from a different address than `https://lnkiai.github.io/m3e-canvas/agent.md`, build the link on that address instead (the app lives next to its guide).

Keep the document under about 100 KB. An `image` part may carry `"src": "https://…"` pointing at a picture on the web; do not embed image data.

Rough placement is fine. The person presses **Tidy** and bars snap to the edges, neighbouring parts fuse into connected runs, and the rest stacks on 16dp margins. Spend your effort on the right parts, sensible labels, and the navigation between screens.

## The document

```jsonc
{
  "title": "Recipes",              // the app's name
  "brief": "Save and search recipes.",   // one or two sentences on what the app is for (optional)
  "frame": "phone",                // always "phone"
  "platform": "android",           // "android" (default) or "web"
  "paletteKey": "purple",          // "purple" | "blue" | "green" | "coral" | "amber" | "teal" | "mono"
  "theme": { "dark": false, "bothModes": true, "contrast": "standard", "shape": "rounded", "font": "roboto", "emphasized": false, "motion": "expressive" },
  "frames": [ /* screens */ ],
  "groups": [ /* parts, bottom layer first */ ]
}
```

`theme` is optional. `contrast`: `standard | medium | high`. `shape`: `square | rounded | full`. `font`: `roboto | robotoFlex | robotoSerif | system`. `motion`: `standard | expressive`. `bothModes: true` asks for light and dark; `dark` picks which one the canvas shows.

### Screens (`frames`)

A phone screen is **412 × 892**; a desktop screen is **1280 × 800** (set `w` and `h`). Place screens side by side on the canvas, 80 apart:

```json
{ "id": "home", "name": "Home", "x": 0, "y": 0, "note": "Lists the saved recipes." }
{ "id": "detail", "name": "Recipe", "x": 492, "y": 0 }
{ "id": "settings", "name": "Settings", "x": 984, "y": 0, "swipe": { "left": "home" } }
```

- `id`: any unique string. `name`: what the screen is called in the prompt.
- `note` (optional): what the screen is for, in a sentence. It goes into the prompt.
- `bg` (optional): background token, one of `surface | surfaceContainerLow | surfaceContainer | surfaceContainerHigh | surfaceContainerHighest | primaryContainer | secondaryContainer | tertiaryContainer | primary | inverseSurface`.
- `swipe` (optional): screens reached by swiping `left | right | up | down`.
- `place` (optional): where the body rows sit between the bars when the screen is tidied: `top` (default) | `center` | `bottom` | `spread`. Goes into the prompt too.

### Parts (`groups`)

Every part sits in a **group**. A group is one part, or a **connected run** of parts of one family drawn as a unit: buttons side by side (`"axis": "x"`), list items stacked (`"axis": "y"`). Coordinates are **canvas coordinates**, so add the screen's `x` and `y`. Later groups draw on top of earlier ones.

```json
{ "id": "g1", "x": 0, "y": 0, "axis": "x", "items": [ { "id": "bar", "kind": "topAppBar", "label": "Recipes", "icon": "menu", "icon2": "search", "variant": "filled" } ] }
{ "id": "g2", "x": 16, "y": 112, "axis": "y", "items": [
  { "id": "r1", "kind": "listItem", "label": "Tomato soup", "supporting": "30 min", "icon": "restaurant", "variant": "filled", "action": { "to": "detail", "transition": "slide" } },
  { "id": "r2", "kind": "listItem", "label": "Pancakes", "supporting": "20 min", "icon": "restaurant", "variant": "filled" }
] }
{ "id": "g3", "x": 340, "y": 716, "axis": "x", "items": [ { "id": "fab", "kind": "fab", "label": "", "icon": "add", "variant": "filled", "note": "Opens the new recipe form." } ] }
{ "id": "g4", "x": 0, "y": 788, "axis": "x", "items": [ { "id": "nav", "kind": "bottomNav", "label": "", "icon": null, "variant": "filled",
  "tabs": [ { "icon": "home", "label": "Home" }, { "icon": "search", "label": "Search" }, { "icon": "settings", "label": "Settings" } ],
  "selected": 0,
  "actions": { "tab:2": { "to": "settings", "transition": "fade" } } } ] }
```

Every item needs `id`, `kind`, `label` (may be `""`), `icon` (a Material Symbols name, or `null`) and `variant`. Use `"variant": "filled"` unless you want another look: `filled | tonal | elevated | outlined | text`.

A tab entry is `{ "icon": "home", "label": "Home" }`; `icon` may be omitted on a `tabs` row and `label` may be `""` on a `toolbar`.

Which families connect: `button` with `button`, `iconButton` with `iconButton`, `chip` with `chip` (all `"axis": "x"`), `listItem` with `listItem` (`"axis": "y"`). Anything else is a group of one; `axis` is then irrelevant but required (`"x"`).

### Kinds and their fields

Sizes are in dp; `size` is the width unless noted. Content width inside the phone margins is **380**. Heights below are what the canvas draws when you omit them.

| kind | what it is | useful fields | default size |

| `divider` | divider | | 380 × 16 |
| `badge` | badge | `label` (empty for a dot) | |
| `loadingIndicator` | M3 Expressive loading indicator | `contained` | 48 × 48 |
| `linearProgress` | linear progress | `value` or omit for indeterminate, `wavy` | 380 × 24 |
| `circularProgress` | circular progress | `value` or omit, `wavy` | 48 × 48 |

Fields that any part may carry:

- `note`: what the part does, in your words. It goes into the prompt verbatim, so say what happens on tap, what is saved, what is validated.
- `action`: `{ "to": "<frame id>" | "back", "transition": "slide" | "slideLeft" | "slideUp" | "slideDown" | "fade" | "expand" | "none" }`, the screen a tap opens.
- `toggle` (buttons): `{ "icon": "favorite", "variant": "filled", "label": "Saved" }`, the look after a tap flips it on.

Icons are Material Symbols names (`home`, `search`, `add`, `favorite`, `settings`, `arrow_back`, `more_vert`, `edit`, `delete`, `share`, `restaurant`, `photo_camera`, …).

## Keep it simple

- Leave what the app does not need empty: `"icon": null`, no `icon2`, no `note`, no `supporting`. A top app bar with just a title is normal; not every bar needs a menu and a search icon, not every list row needs a trailing chevron.
- Do not add parts to fill space. A screen with a bar, a list and a FAB is complete.
- One idea per screen. If a screen needs a second scroll of parts, it is two screens.
- Prefer the plain variant (`"filled"`) and the default sizes; the person retunes the theme afterwards.
- Buttons: a main action on its own gets `"size": 380` (full content width); two side by side get `"size": 182` each in one connected group; a button next to text stays text-sized. Do not scatter small buttons around a screen.
- Cards: give one a `size2` only when it holds more than a headline and a line of body, and keep a stack of cards the same height. A list of similar rows is a `listItem` run, not a column of cards.

## A good sketch

- One `topAppBar` at the top of each screen, a `bottomNav` on the main screens with the same tabs everywhere, and `selected` set to the tab that screen belongs to.
- Real labels in the person's language, not lorem ipsum. Match the language of the request.
- A `note` only where the label does not already say what happens; a `note` on every screen.
- Navigation that closes: list rows open a detail screen, detail screens have a way back (`"to": "back"`), the FAB opens a form.
- Three to five screens is plenty. Leave polish to the person: they will tidy, retheme, and edit.

## Checklist before you reply

- Every `id` is unique; every `action.to` names a frame `id` or `back`.
- Every item has `id`, `kind`, `label`, `icon` (or `null`), `variant`.
- Group coordinates include the screen offset.
- You are replying with the link (or the JSON), not with a description of it.
